  /**
    * Wrapper that implements optimized {@link ThreadLocal} access pattern ideal for heavily used
    * ThreadLocals.
    *
    * <p> It is faster to use a mutable holder object and always perform ThreadLocal.get() and never use
    * ThreadLocal.set(), because the value is more likely to be found in the ThreadLocalMap direct hash
    * slot and avoid the slow path ThreadLocalMap.getEntryAfterMiss().
    *
    * <p> Credit to @trask from the FastThreadLocal in glowroot.
    *
    * <p> One small change is that we don't use an kamon-defined holder object as that would prevent class unloading.
