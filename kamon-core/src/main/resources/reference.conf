      # provide minimum and/or maximum sampled traces throughput goals.
      #
      # Groups have two properties: an operation name regex list which decides what operations get into the group and a
      # set of rules for that group. The available rules are:

      #               sample: [always|never] Provides a definitive sampling decision for all operations in the group.
      #                       When this rule is set, the sampler will always return this decision and any other
      #                       configured rule will be ignored.
      #
      #   minimum-throughput: [number] Defines the minimum number of sampled traces expected per minute for each
      #                       operation in the group. Even though the sampler will do its best effort to provide the
      #                       minimum number of sampled traces, the actual minimum will vary depending on application
      #                       traffic and the global throughput goal.
      #
      #   maximum-throughput: [number] Defines the maximum number of sampled traces expected per minute for each
      #                       operation in the group, regardless of whether there is room left before meeting the global
      #                       throughput goal.
