    # very conservative value and its equal to the total number of buckets required to cover values

    # that would need to have at least one measurement on every bucket of a single histogram to

    # if you wish to change the precision and lowest discernible value of the `elapsed-time` instrument for the `trace`
    # category, you should include the following configuration in your application.conf file:
    #
    #   kamon.metric.instrument-settings.trace {
    #     elapsed-time {
    #       precision = fine
    #       lowest-discernible-value = 1000
    #     }
    #   }

    # In this example, the value for the `highest-trackable-value` setting will be either the code setting or the default
    # setting, depending on how the `elapsed-time` metric is created.
