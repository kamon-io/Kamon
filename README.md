Kamon is a set of tools for instrumenting applications running on the JVM. The best way to get started is to go to our
official [Get Started Page](https://kamon.io/get-started/) and start instrumenting your applications right away! There
you will also find guides and reference documentation for the core APIs, instrumentation and reporting modules.
