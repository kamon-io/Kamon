/**
 * Indicates that concurrent invocations of the annotated method should be tracked with a Kamon Range Sampler. The Range
 * Sampler is incremented when the annotated method starts executing and decremented when it finishes. If the return
 * type of the annotated method is a Future or CompletionStage, the Range Sampler will be decremented when the Future or
 * CompletionStage completes.
 *
 * For example, given a method like this:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @TrackConcurrency(name = "coolName", tags="${'my-cool-tag':'my-cool-operationName'}")
 * public String coolName(String name) {
 *   return "Hello " + name;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link kamon.metric.RangeSampler RangeSampler} named {@code coolName} will be incremented every time the annotated
 * method starts executing and decremented every time it finishes executing.
