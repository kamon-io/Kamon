/**
  * Thin wrapper used while exchanging an UnstartedCell for a real ActorCell instance. This wrapper is only
  * meant to be used during the execution of UnstartedCell.replaceWith(...), for the sole purpose of ensuring
  * that all messages that might have been accumulated in the UnstartedCell will get their Context propagated
  * as expected.
  *
  * For reference, we used to have a copy/pasted and modified version of UnstartedCell.replaceWith(...) as part
  * of the instrumentation, but there were tiny bugs related to accessing internal state on the UnstartedCell while
  * running our modified version of the method. These bugs lead to losing System Messages in certain situations,
  * which eventually leads to actors not being shut down. The CellWrapper approach ensures that the internal calls
  * to UnstartedCell.replaceWith#drainSysmsgQueue() are unchanged, while still ensuring that the Kamon Context
  * will be propagated for all queued messages.
