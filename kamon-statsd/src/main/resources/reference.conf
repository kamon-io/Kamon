      # with one of the following strategies:
      #   - normalize: changes ': ' to '-' and ' ', '/' and '.' to '_'.
      #   - percent-encode: percent encode the section on the metric name. Please note that StatsD doesn't support
      #     percent encoded metric names, this option is only useful if using our docker image which has a patched
      #     version of StatsD or if you are running your own, customized version of StatsD that supports this.
