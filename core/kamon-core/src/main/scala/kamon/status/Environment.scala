/**
  * Describes the conditions on which the instrumented application is running. This information is typically used by
  * reporter modules to enrich the data before it is sent to external systems. Kamon will always try to create an
  * appropriate Environment instance based on the details found on the "kamon.environment" configuration settings and
  * then exposed through an instance of this class.
  *
  * Starting from a service name, Kamon will try to figure out how to create the Environment instance using:
  *
  *   - The "kamon.environment.host" setting as the hostname where this application is running. If the value "auto"
  *     (default) is present, Kamon will try to resolve the hostname automatically and use it.
  *
  *   - The "kamon.environment.instance" setting as the name of the this instance. Typically there will be several JVMs
  *     running the exact same service code on different hosts and even though they should share the same "service"
  *     name, each one should have its own identifier. If the value "auto" (default) is present, Kamon will generate an
  *     instance name with the pattern "service@host".
  *
  *   - The "kamon.environment.tags" are additional key/value pairs with information about the conditions on which this
  *     service is running. They will typically be used to include things like the Datacenter name or region, software
  *     versions and so on.
  *
  * Finally, the incarnation is a randomly generated string that uniquely identifies this JVM. The incarnation value
  * remains the same even after Kamon gets reconfigured and its host, service, instance or tags are changed.
