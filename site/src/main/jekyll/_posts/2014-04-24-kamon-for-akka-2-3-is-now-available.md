Dear community,

We are happy to announce that Kamon 0.3.0, our latest release, is out and compatible with Akka 2.3! From now on, all of
our releases will come in pairs and aligned with the following Akka versions:

* 0.3.x releases are compatible with Akka 2.3, Spray 1.3 and Play 2.3-M1.
* 0.2.x releases are compatible with Akka 2.2, Spray 1.2 and Play 2.2.

The 0.3.0/0.2.0 releases contain exactly the same feature set as our 0.0.15 release, we just made the necessary changes
to make it compatible with Akka 2.3. If you were waiting for this release, then go and [get started] right away!
