    # conditions:
    #  - When a server side request is received containing the trace token header, the new `TraceContext` will have that
    #    some token, and once the response to that request is ready, the trace token header is also included in the
    #    response.
    #  - When a WS client request is issued and a `TraceContext` is available, the trace token header will be included
    #    in the request headers.
