  # If ask-pattern-timeout-warning is enabled, a WARN level log message will be generated if a Future generated by the
  # "ask" pattern fails with an AskTimeoutException and the log message will contain information depending of the
  # selected strategy. The possible values are:
  #
  #   - off: nothing gets logged.
  #   - lightweight: logs a warning when a timeout is reached using source location.

  # Automatically creates Actor Groups that contain all actors of the same Class at the same level of the Actor System
  # tree. This will only be applied to actors that are not individually tracked, that are not part of another groups and
  # that match the "auto-grouping" filter bellow. This allows, for example, to automatically get metrics from anonymous
  # actors without messing with filters and risking cardinality explosions.
  #
  auto-grouping = on

  # Filters control how and if the instrumentation will track the behavior of Akka Actors, Routers, Dispatchers and
  # Actor Groups. All filters have two groups of patterns: includes and excludes; inputs matching at least one of the
  # includes patterns and none of the excludes patterns will be accepted. You can read more about filters on the Kamon
  # documentation: https://kamon.io/docs/latest/core/utilities/
  #
  # The test string for the filters is always starting with the Actor System name, followed by the path to the
  # component being tested. For example, when testing for a "test" actor created at the root of the "akka-example" Actor
  # System, the test string for the filter will be "akka-example/user/test" and, when testing the default dispatcher for
  # that same Actor System the test string for the filters will be "akka-example/akka.actor.default-dispatcher".

    # group, add a configuration like the following:

    #   kamon.instrumentation.akka.filters.groups {
    #     worker-actors {
    #       includes = [ "my-system/user/application/worker-*", "my-system/user/workers/**" ]
    #       excludes = [ ]
    #     }
    #   }
    #
    # The configuration key immediately inside the "groups" path corresponds to the group name and the configuration
    # inside of it should contain a Kamon filter (with the includes/excludes settings).

      # configuration which usually results in cardinality explosions and/or OOM errors. Since the introduction of auto
      # grouping, the instrumentation will do a much better work at providing metrics out of the box and forbids the use
      # of the "doomsday" wildcard. Enable and use at your own risk.
